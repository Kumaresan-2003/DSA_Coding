# DSA_Coding

## Overview

This repository contains various scripts and implementations related to data structures and algorithms (DSA). It includes examples and exercises to practice and understand different data structures and algorithms.

## Project Structure

- **`proper-k/`**: Contains the implementation of various algorithms and data structures.
- **`Arrays practice/`**: Scripts and exercises related to array operations and manipulations.
- **`Binary search tree/`**: Implementation of binary search trees and related algorithms.
- **`Double Linked List and Circular Linked List/`**: Implementations of double linked lists and circular linked lists.
- **`Search and Sorting/`**: Algorithms for searching and sorting techniques.
- **`Singly LinkedList/`**: Implementation of singly linked lists.
- **`Stack and Queue/`**: Implementations of stack and queue data structures.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a programming environment set up to run the scripts. The scripts are primarily written in Java. Ensure the necessary compiler or interpreter is installed.

### Running the Scripts

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kumaresan-2003/DSA_Coding.git
